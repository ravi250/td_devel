oraunload.sql
=============
Generates unload scripts for Oracle tables. Very simple to execute with SQL*Plus.

A fastload script for Teradata will also be generated.

Does some manipulation of the data, to get it easily unloaded and loaded.
Is limited to line length. But has no other software requirements besides SQL*Plus.
