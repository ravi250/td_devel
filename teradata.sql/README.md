read_dd4Datamodelling.sql
=========================
A while ago, I've created an Excel Document, to generate Teradata DDLs for the creation of tables and views.
The initial intention was the ability to turn an Oracle table to a Teradata table.
By unloading the Oracle Datadictionary to two Excel sheets (Table Info, Column Info).
This SQL generates the data for the Excel from Teradata Dictionary.
(Somewhere, I must have the Oracle equivalent of this SQL) ;)
